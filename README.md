### 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm currently an App Development Intern at **Travel Radar**, where I contribute to a cross-platform mobile app using **Flutter**, **Firebase**, and **SQL**, while working in a remote Agile team.  
My passion lies in building real-time, intelligent, and impactful tools — whether that's a gesture-controlled game, a dance analysis AI, or a rocket telemetry system.

🔧 Technologies I love working with:
- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, C#, SQL, MATLAB  
- **Frameworks:** React, Node.js, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Flutter  
- **Tools:** Unity, Firebase, Git, Arduino, Unreal Engine  

🎮 Some of my recent projects:
- 🎯 *Gesture-Controlled Space Shooter Game* — Accessibility-focused game using hand tracking  
- 🕺 *AI Dance Performance Evaluator* — Full-stack tool analyzing motion & expression with OpenCV/MediaPipe
